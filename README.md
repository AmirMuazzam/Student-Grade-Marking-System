# Student-Grade-Marking-System
The Student Grade Marking System is a project developed to assist in managing and recording student grades. The project is implemented using C++, providing functionalities to create individual student records and display the records of all students.

Features:

Create Student Record: This feature allows the user to input relevant information such as student name, ID, and grades for different subjects. The system then stores and organizes this information for future reference.

View All Student Records: With this feature, the user can retrieve and display the records of all students in a well-formatted manner. This provides a comprehensive overview of the students' grades and progress.

This project is designed to streamline the process of recording and accessing student grades, offering convenience and efficiency to educators, administrators, or anyone involved in managing student data.
